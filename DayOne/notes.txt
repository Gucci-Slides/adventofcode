understand the problem
track how much calories a given elf is carrying
what elf is carrying the most and how much

break into smaller problems
dictionary where key is elf number, value is sum of calories
since we are given a list of only the calories grouped by whitespace before next group
the iterator will be the key 

create the dictionary
add key and value into dictionary
how do you go about adding a key and a value into a dictionary
"Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it"

example:
{
	1: 6000,
	2: 4000
}

where the keys (1,2) are incrimented from zero to the length of the data
the values are the sums (where the first elf was carrying 1000, 2000, and 3000 calories)

breaking down summing the calories
keep a rolling sum until the whitespace comes

need to add first integer to second to third
1000 + 2000 + 3000
not 
1000 + 1000 + 2000 + 2000 + 3000 + 3000

problem im facing
the next iteration is not saving the previous value
